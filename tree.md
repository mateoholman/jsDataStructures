Trie
- A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the String associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty String.
